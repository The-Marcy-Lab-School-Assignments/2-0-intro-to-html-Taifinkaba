# Question
What does it mean when a tag is a "child" of a "parent?".

# Answer
HTML is seen as a tree. Within the tree you have ancestors, descendants, parents, children and siblings. When a tag is referred as a "parent" it is because it is connected to the main tag. When a tag is referred as a "child" it is because the tag comes after "parent". Example is 
```html
<body>
    <ol>
        <li></li>
    </ol>
</body>

```
`ol` is connected to the main tag `body` so it's a "parent".
`li` is connected to a secondary tag `ol` so it's a "child".
